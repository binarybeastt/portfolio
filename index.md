### Maize seed defect detection using YOLO-v5 object detection framework

In this project, I built a classifier using PyTorch to accurately detect and classify defective maize seeds and separates them from the healthy seeds, this helps farmers save cultivation land and only plant seeds which are healthy. The model achieves very high accuracy and has an mAP score of over 90%. The final model was deployed as an android application.

### MachineHack Analytics Olympiad
The MachineHack Analytics Olympiad was a predictive modelling challenge commissioned by researchers at Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence in 2022. In the challenge, participants were tasked with predicting which Insurance claims are worth rejecting and which claims should be accepted for reimbursement.

I took part in this challenge, using various ML techniques including: (i) imputing missing values and KNN, (ii) modelling with MLP, Random Forests and XGBoost models, (iii) Hyperparameter optimisation, and (iv) using feature importance scores to interpret the models' predictions.
